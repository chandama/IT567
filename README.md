A work in progress TCP/UDP/ICMP port scanning tool written in Python. This tool uses many switches and inputs similar to nmap. Scapy must be installed and configured correctly for UDP scanning to work properly. Cross-platform functionality has been tested and this tool should work both on Windows or Linux platforms.
